Reconciling~

Ledger_X implements an interactive reconciliation function.  Type <leader>lr
in an unmodified ledger window.  At the prompt, enter a partial or full
account name to reconcile.  A location list window will appear containing
uncleared postings for that account.

Three keys have special meaning in the reconciliation location list:

Space will toggle the "pending" state of the posting under the cursor.
Uncleared postings will be marked "->", and cleared ones will be marked "*>".

Greater-than (">") will commit "pending" actions.  Postings marked "->" will
be converted to "*".  Postings with "*>" will have all status flags removed.

Each group of postings committed with ">" will be assigned a distinct
reconciliation ID.  This can be used for auditing and to verify that old
transactions have not been accidentally modified.

Syntax~

Ledger_X includes an experimental syntax highlighting that attempts to parse
the ledger file format more completely.

It can be enabled by entering this command from a ledger window

  :set filetype=ledger_x

Installing~

Be sure to install Vim-Ledger first.  Ledger_X will not work without
Vim-Ledger installed.  Vim-Ledger is at https://github.com/ledger/vim-ledger

Ledger_X provides a number of files in subdirectories.  Place them into
corresponding directories in your vim 'runtimepath'.  Pathogen, Vundle, etc.
may make this easier to manage.
